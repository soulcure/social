description: A Flutter plugin for embedding Unity projects in Flutter projects.
# Although semantic versioning doesn’t promise any compatibility between
# versions prior to 1.0.0, the Dart community convention is to treat those
# versions semantically as well. The interpretation of each number is just
# shifted down one slot: going from 0.1.2 to 0.2.0 indicates a breaking change,
# going to 0.1.3 indicates a new feature, and going to 0.1.2+1 indicates a
# change that doesn’t affect the public API.
version: 0.3.0

  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
